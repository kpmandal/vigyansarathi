          <p>Greetings, dedicated aspirants! In our last journey, we mastered the art of describing motion. Now, we ask the fundamental question: <strong>Why</strong> does motion happen? What causes an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction? The answer to all these questions is a single concept: <strong>Force</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Section 5: The Grand Finale - The Law of Conservation of Momentum üåå</h2>
          <p>This is one of the most fundamental conservation laws in all of physics.</p>
          <p>The law states: <strong>"In the absence of an external unbalanced force, the total momentum of a system of objects remains constant (or conserved)."</strong></p>
          <p>In simpler terms, for a collision between two or more objects in an isolated system, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.</p>

          <h3>Derivation from Newton's Third Law</h3>
          
          {/* === FIX #1: Escaping the '>' character === */}
          <p>Consider two balls, A and B, of masses m‚Çê and m‚Çë, travelling in the same direction with initial velocities u‚Çê and u‚Çë respectively. Let's assume u‚Çê > u‚Çë so they collide.</p>
          
          <ul className="styled-list">
              <li>During the collision (for a time t), ball A exerts a force F‚Çê‚Çë on ball B.</li>
              <li>Simultaneously, ball B exerts a force F‚Çë‚Çê on ball A.</li>
              <li>According to the Third Law: <code>F‚Çê‚Çë = - F‚Çë‚Çê</code></li>
              <li>Using the Second Law (F=ma), we can write: <code>m‚Çêa‚Çê = - m‚Çëa‚Çë</code></li>
              <li>Substituting a = (v-u)/t: <code>m‚Çê(v‚Çê - u‚Çê)/t = - m‚Çë(v‚Çë - u‚Çë)/t</code></li>
              <li>Canceling 't' from both sides: <code>m‚Çê(v‚Çê - u‚Çê) = - m‚Çë(v‚Çë - u‚Çë)</code></li>
              <li>Expanding the terms: <code>m‚Çêv‚Çê - m‚Çêu‚Çê = -m‚Çëv‚Çë + m‚Çëu‚Çë</code></li>
              <li>Rearranging the terms by bringing initial momentums to one side and final momentums to the other:</li>
              <li><strong><code>m‚Çêu‚Çê + m‚Çëu‚Çë = m‚Çêv‚Çê + m‚Çëv‚Çë</code></strong></li>
              <li>This equation shows that the <strong>Total Momentum Before Collision = Total Momentum After Collision</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Inertia depends on mass. (a) The <strong>stone</strong> has more mass. (b) The <strong>train</strong> has more mass. (c) The <strong>five-rupees coin</strong> has more mass. Therefore, these objects have more inertia.</p>
