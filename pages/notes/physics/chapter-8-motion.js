          <p>Welcome, future achievers! Motion is the first and most fundamental concept in Physics. It is the language we use to describe the universe, from a falling apple to the orbits of planets. For competitive exams, a rock-solid understanding of this chapter is non-negotiable. It forms the base for more advanced topics like Force, Work, and Gravitation.</p>
          <p>In this definitive guide from <strong>Vigyan Sarathi</strong>, we will embark on a journey to demystify every aspect of motion. We will break down complex ideas into simple, digestible pieces, fortified with real-world examples and exam-oriented questions, ensuring you are not just prepared, but truly confident.</p>

          <h2>Section 1: What is Motion? ü§î The Concept of a Reference Point</h2>
          <p>In our daily lives, we see things move all the time: a running car, a flying bird, a flowing river. But in Physics, motion is defined more precisely. An object is said to be in a <strong>state of motion</strong> if its position changes continuously with respect to a fixed point in its surroundings. This fixed point is called the <strong>reference point</strong> or the <strong>origin</strong>.</p>
          <p>Conversely, an object is in a <strong>state of rest</strong> if its position does not change with respect to its reference point. This means motion is always <strong>relative</strong>. For a passenger inside a moving train, their co-passengers are at rest. But for a person standing on the platform, both the train and all the passengers are in motion. Without a reference point, the terms "rest" and "motion" have no meaning.</p>
          
          <div className="fact-box">
              <h4>üí° One-Liner Facts: Motion & Rest</h4>
              <p>‚û§ Motion is the change of an object's position with time relative to a reference point.<br/>
              ‚û§ Rest and Motion are relative terms; an object can be at rest relative to one thing and in motion relative to another.</p>

          <h2>Section 2: Distance vs. Displacement üõ£Ô∏è - The Most Important Distinction</h2>
          <p>This is one of the most tested concepts in basic physics. While we often use these words interchangeably in daily conversation, in physics, they have very different meanings.</p>
          
          <h3>Distance: The Total Path Covered</h3>
          <p><strong>Distance</strong> is the actual length of the path an object travels, regardless of its direction. It is a <strong>scalar quantity</strong>, which means it only has magnitude (a numerical value, e.g., 10 km) and no direction. Distance can never be zero or negative if the object has moved.</p>

          <h3>Displacement: The Shortest Path from Start to Finish</h3>
          <p><strong>Displacement</strong> is the shortest straight-line distance between the initial position and the final position of an object. It is a <strong>vector quantity</strong>, meaning it has both magnitude and direction (e.g., 1 km East). Displacement can be zero (if the object returns to its starting point), positive, or negative.</p>
          
          <div className="exam-spotlight-box">
              <h4>üéØ Exam Spotlight: A Detailed Example</h4>
              <p>Imagine a person starts at their home (Point O). They walk 400 meters East to a shop (Point A). Then, they turn and walk 300 meters North to a friend's house (Point B).</p>
              <ul className="styled-list">
                  <li><strong>Calculating Distance:</strong> The total path is simply the sum of the individual paths. Distance = 400 m + 300 m = <strong>700 m</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Calculating Displacement:</strong> The displacement is the straight line from the start (O) to the finish (B). This forms a right-angled triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem (a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤):
                  <br/><code>Displacement¬≤ = 400¬≤ + 300¬≤ = 160000 + 90000 = 250000</code>
                  <br/><code>Displacement = ‚àö250000 = 500 m</code>.
                  <br/>The full displacement is <strong>500 m in the North-East direction</strong>.
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="fact-box">
              <h4>üí° One-Liner Facts: Distance & Displacement</h4>
              <p>‚û§ Distance is a scalar quantity (magnitude only); Displacement is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction).<br/>
              ‚û§ Distance is the total path length; Displacement is the shortest distance between start and end points.<br/>
              ‚û§ For a moving object, distance is always positive, while displacement can be positive, negative, or zero.<br/>
              ‚û§ The magnitude of displacement is always less than or equal to the distance traveled.</p>
